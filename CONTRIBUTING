# Contributing to GenGraph

Thanks for your interest in this weird little experiment.

At this stage, contributions that are **most helpful** include:

- Opening issues describing:
  - Real-world genealogical use cases that this model doesn't handle well
  - Existing standards / formats we should align with
  - Concerns about privacy, ethics, or misuse
- Proposing changes to `SPEC.md`:
  - Better field names
  - Additional entity types
  - Cleaner relation semantics
- Providing example data:
  - Small, anonymised graphs illustrating tricky scenarios
-Calling out additional gaps in the .GED file format and proprietary variants with ancestry websites that need resolving in a future format like ths one

## Ground rules

- Be kind. Many contributors will come from different domains (genealogy, archives,
  SSI, graph databases, etc.).
- Assume good faith, critique ideas not people.
- Use issues and pull requests for technical changes.
- If you're proposing a major change to the data model:
  - Please start by opening an issue
  - Or draft a short proposal document and link it from the issue

## Development

There's a tiny Python helper that can load and summarise GenGraph files:

```bash
python -m gengraph examples/minimal_example.gengraph.json
