# Discussion Topics & Open Questions

This file is intentionally opinionated to spark debate.

## 1. Entities vs. claims

Right now, relations connect `fromId` → `toId` with a simple `type`.

- Should we introduce a first-class **Claim/Assertion** object?
- Would that be overkill for most genealogists?
- How do we balance simple usage vs. rigorous provenance?

## 2. Alignment with existing standards

- Which existing vocabularies/ontologies (e.g., FOAF, CIDOC-CRM, GEDCOM X, GEDCOM 7)
  should we look at for inspiration or alignment?
- Is it better to:
  - define a small, pragmatic core, or
  - aim for direct compatibility with a specific existing standard?

## 3. IDs and global identity

- Should GenGraph encourage:
  - simple local IDs (P1, P2) only, or
  - optional global IDs (URIs, ARKs, DOIs, DIDs, etc.)?
- How do we handle the "same person in multiple files" problem?
- Is there a future for **self-sovereign identity** style approaches here?

## 4. Privacy and ethics

- How should we handle living persons?
  - Separate encrypted files?
  - Flags at the Person level?
- How might this data be misused?
  - What design choices could mitigate abuse?

## 5. Titles and land

- What minimal structure would support:
  - "lost titles" / "dropped titles" analysis?
  - property / land history analysis?
- Should we encode basic inheritance rules at the Title level?
- How far do we go into legal modelling vs. leaving that to external tools?

## 6. GEDCOM interop

- If you maintain genealogy software, what would you need to:
  - Export GenGraph?
  - Import GenGraph?
- Are there "must-have" items for GEDCOM compatibility that are currently missing?
